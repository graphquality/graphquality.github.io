											<h2>Call for Papers : the GRAPH-QUALITY Workshop</h2>
											<p> Co-located with ECML-PKDD, September 2022.</p>
										</header>
										<p align="justify">
											We invite contributions in the area of Data and Model Quality for Mining and Learning with relational data (measures, algorithms, models, tools, evaluations, etc.) to be presented at the GRAPH-QUALITY workshop which is to be held at the European Conference on Machine Learning and Principles and Practices of Knowledge Discovery from Data (ECML-PKDD), in Grenoble, France - 19 – 23 September 2022.
										</p>	
										<p align="justify">
											This workshop aims to explore the different aspects of quality of graph data and models of graphs, in the context of graph mining and machine learning on graphs. Like all data, graphs may be noisy. For example, links and nodes may be missing or have wrong attribute values (random noise), there may be structural errors in the collection or coding (bias), this bias may be related to protected groups (fairness), the graph may have been tampered with (adversarial changes), etc. Further, calibrated noise may be added purposefully to address privacy concerns. Owing to the structured and non-i.i.d. nature of the objects that comprise a graph, special methods are needed to address these questions.
										</p>	
										<p align="justify">
											To address data quality issues for graphs, the first step is to have methods to identify possible problems and present such insights. That is, methods are needed specifically to identify bias, outliers, noise, unexpected values, etc. Such methods may be fully automatic or have a human-in-the-loop component and for example employ graph visualisation for interaction. Secondly, modeling and prediction typically depend on a machine learning step, fitting a model to the graph. Robust methods that learn models on graphs with noisy data must be developed. Further, evaluation of bias/fairness in the outcome of the model, should be balanced with the model prediction quality. Moreover, there is little research on exploring the interaction between data and model quality.
										</p>	
										<p align="justify">
											This workshop aims to connect researchers working on this area, provide a platform for presentation of the latest developments in new methods, and stimulate discussion of these issues.

												<h3>Submission Information</h3>
											</header>
											
												All papers will be peer-reviewed single-blind. We welcome many kinds of papers, such as (and not limited to):
											<ul class="intext">
											<li> Novel research papers </li>
											<li> Demo papers </li>
											<li> Work-in-progress papers </li>
											<li> Visionary papers (white papers) </li>
											<li> Appraisal papers of existing methods and tools (e.g., lessons learned) </li>
											<li> Relevant work that has been (partially) published previously </li>
											</ul>
											</br>
											<p align="justify">
											Authors should indicate in their abstracts the kind of submissions that the paper belongs to, to help reviewers better understand their contributions. Submissions must be in PDF, written in English, not longer than 16 pages (including references and supplemental material), and formatted according to the standard <a href="#">Springer LNCS style</a>. Shorter papers (including extended abstracts) are also welcome.
											Accepted papers will be presented as a poster in the poster session and a few will be selected to also give an oral presentation. The papers will be posted on the workshop website (unless the authors opt out), but will not be published in a formal proceeding.
											For accepted papers, at least one author must register for the conference and attend the workshop to present the work.
